In order to run these macros you will need to change some settings in Darkfall.
First off you will need to go to your GUI OPTIONS in Darkfall options and set the
active/inactive/game mode window opacties all the way to the right (opaque, non transperant).
Doing this can be easily done by sliding the game mode window slider all the way to the right
which will in drag the rest of the sliders with it.

Next you will need to set up some of your binding which are already set in the macro.
The most important binding is the unsheathe key. Go to input bindings then to interaction.
This is very important... DO NOT CHANGE your >>TOGGLE<< Unsheathe Object
It will look like this:

Toggle unsheathe object: <--NOT here
Tigger Current item:
Unsheate Object: <--Here
Use:

Now the one you will want to change is the one that only literally says "Unsheathe object".
Now click it and change it to ctrl+blackslash. Most people get slash and blackslash confused.
Please re-check the binding so it looks like this:

Unsheate Object: LEFT_CTRL+BACKSLASH

Good job.

Never cover, close, move the hotbar, health bar, or target healthbar when using these macros (target healthbar
excluded in the magic macro).





FOR GROUP SEX!
==========================================================================================================

Now we need to set up your hotbar. Find an empty hotbar. You will need rank 0 weapons, staffs, food, regs.
I will order it in the position is should go in.
1 weapon
2 staff
3 food
4 special attack/rage
5 mana to stam
6 disease or arrow ward
7 melee haste or rapid shot
8 ironskin
9 witches brew
0 heal other or sacrafice

These keys will need to be keys 1 - 0 on your bindings.

Additional Hotkeys:

ctrl + F11 -Extra Food
ctrl + F12 -Extra Food

Numpad Period - Health to Mana (YOU MUST BIND THIS KEY)

These can be binded to any part of your hotbar using the GUI tab in Input Bindings in darkfall.

For auto equip armor you will need to find yet another free hotbar.
Open your paperdoll as you look at it, I have the armor set on the hotbar taken from the paperdoll in a
clockwise fasion. I will take you through this. At the top of your paperdoll (12:00) is your helm..
so your helm will go into hotbar slot ONE, next (3:00) shoulderpads hotbar slot TWO then down to your
gloves (slot 5) greaves (slot 7) legs (slot 9) and chest (slot 0). If you dont understand this, delete
the macro now.

Now becasue the macro will always be on the hotbar that has your staff, weapon and food and will be press by keys
1-0, we will need to set up additional hotkeys for equipping armor on the fly. Go to Input Bindings then to the GUI
Tab and find which hotbar you set up your armor on. (If you do not know how to use this function in darkfall
the macro will not work for you... try to find some help or delete the macro.) When you find the correct hotbar slot
in GUI bind them like this:
slot 0 ctrl F10
slot 1 ctrl F1
slot 2 ctrl F2
all the way to -
slot 9 ctrl F9

Now you are ready to run the macro.

When you run group sex, you need to fill out the timers and gm response. The timers are in milliseconds. Im too
lazy to list all the timers for spells, however:
Your special attack delay is how long it takes to make en entire swing with the weapon you have in milliseconds.
With daggers it is short, with polearm it is long. (200-800)
VMware slowdown should always be 150 if your arent lagging, if you are lagging, using vmware or your comptuer sucks
make it it bit higher.
In order to start the macro you will need to select yes or no with auto equip armor.

You need your paperdoll out in order for the auto equip armor to work.

Now to get it running you need to have full health full mana and full stam. Your target needs to have full health
also (however you can get healthbars off buildings and such). If the macro gets stuck looking for the
targets health bar position, wiggle your mouse around on the target without loosing the health bar on your
screen, play with it a bit... it will work. Thats the only kind of buggy thing about the macro.

Delete is pause - when you pause you can go anywhere and come back unpause with delete again and resume the macro.
End is exit the macro.
It runs in windowed mode better than any other mode.

Im sure theres more to put here but I cant think of it.

=============================================================================================================


For rapid magic:

Rapid magic casts 1 to 5 spells, refils health, mana and stam and automatically re equipps broken staffs.
It is very easy to use:
Spells go on slots 1-5
staff is slot 6
Health to mana 7
Mana to stam 8
Stam to health 9

Run when you have full health mana and stam!

=============================================================================================================

For Hivekin Queen Script:

Start it on a full hp bar.

Use SLOT ZERO "0" as heal other OR sacrafice.
