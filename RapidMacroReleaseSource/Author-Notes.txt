Previous version of Rapid Melee.
Note: Break OP did not write these macros. Xzyzz did not make the macro that has been passed around on EU, he got that code from me and
took credit for it himself. This is the freshest verions of my macros and is now being passed out to
the public. I am no longer giving the source code out.

The newest version of group sex will allow the use of seige hammers and a seperate key for health to mana.
Rapid magic is a script that refills health/mana/stam and re-equips staffs while you macro magic.
Rapid magic has been working flawlessly for quite some time, and is very useful.
